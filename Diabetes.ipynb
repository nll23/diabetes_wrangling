Also, all the metadata is stored in one table making it difficult if we want to join the table with the main table. There are also some other issues with this dataset and hence we chose to work on it. In this project, we will wrangle the dataset into a tidy format and split the metadata into several seperate tables which will make a coherent relational data model."
