    "The dataset is available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008. \n",
    "It contains data for 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks. It includes over 50 features representing patient and hospital outcomes. Information was extracted from the database for encounters that satisfied a set of criteria which could be found at the data page. There are two tables in this dataset, one is the table containing all the data and the other is the metadata table.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to build a model to predict the readmitted type of the encounter based on the various information in the diabetic dataset. The readmitted type reflects the days to inpatient readmission. Values is “<30” if the patient was readmitted in less than 30 days, “>30” if the patient was readmitted in more than 30 days, and “No” for no record of readmission. This is a classification problem\n",

    "### We can find that the diabetes table is quite messy, there are many missing values represented by \"?\" and many of the categorical data fields are labeled using \"Yes\" and \"No\" and some other notations which is not efficient for analysis. And the values in the age column are ranges which is difficult to handle. Also, all the metadata is stored in one table making it difficult if we want to join the table with the main table. There are also some other issues with this dataset and hence we chose to work on it. In this project, we will wrangle the dataset into a tidy format and split the metadata into several seperate tables which will make a coherent relational data model."
